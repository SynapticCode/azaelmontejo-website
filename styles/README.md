# Styles README

## Overview
This folder contains the modular CSS for the main azaelmontejo.com website. All styles for the homepage and its sections are managed here in `main.css`.

## Updates (2024-07-01)
- Migrated all inline and embedded CSS from `index.html` to `styles/main.css` for modularity and maintainability.
- Implemented a modern dark theme: deep blue-black backgrounds, high-contrast white and off-white text, and orange/purple accent colors.
- Added utility classes:
  - `.card-title` for all card and section headings (bright white)
  - `.card-body` for card and section body text (off-white)
  - `.card-link` for card links (now orange, matching site accent)
  - `.btn-blog` for the blog button (gradient, modern look)
- Ensured all cards, headings, and links are readable and visually consistent across the site.
- Added a landing overlay for immersive entry experience.

## Maintenance
- Update `main.css` for any future color, font, or layout changes.
- Use utility classes for all new cards/sections for consistency.
- Keep this README updated with all major style changes.
