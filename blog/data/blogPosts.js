        title: "My Thesis is the Bridge: Why I'm Pursuing Both Computer Science and Civil Justice",

        category: "Education, Social Impact, Personal Journey",
        excerpt: "The late July air hangs thick and sweet over the Princeton campus, a world I still navigate with a quiet sense of wonder. It's been nine weeks. nine weeks of walking beneath gothic spires, of late-night study sessions in Firestone Library, of feeling the immense gravity of an institution built on centuries of inquiry. nine weeks of living a dream. But just a couple months ago, that dream felt like it was made of glass, threatening to shatter. I remember the conversation vividly. The words were delivered with kindness, but they landed with the force of a closing door: 'We have an issue. Your parole stipulations… you might not be able to stay on campus. They need you home. Every night.' Home. Newark. An hour-and-a-half journey that suddenly felt like a gulf separating two different worlds. In that moment, the dream dissolved. Princeton wasn't the sanctuary I had reached; it was just a place I could visit, a temporary pass into a life I wasn't yet fully permitted to live. I saw the future I was trying to build being pulled away by the tether of a past I couldn't cut. I was ready to make the commute, to sacrifice sleep and immersion for even a piece of the opportunity. But I knew what it meant: I would be an observer, not a participant. The late-night collaborations, the spontaneous talks with colleagues, the simple feeling of belonging—all of it would be out of reach. Then came the anticipation. The tense silence of waiting. A leader in the program refused to accept the initial verdict. He saw the potential, not the restriction. He stepped into that gulf between my past and my future and began to build a bridge. I wasn't privy to the calls. I couldn't hear the negotiations with my parole officer, the patient explanations to their supervisors, the persistent, respectful case being made on my behalf. All I could do was wait, suspended in uncertainty, while a quiet battle was waged for my future. Every day that passed, the question echoed: Will I get to stay? And then, the call came. The words were simple, but they were everything. 'It's approved. Monday through Friday on campus. You go home on the weekends'. A wave of profound relief washed over me, so potent it was physical. The tether had been loosened. The door hadn't just been unlocked; it had been taken off its hinges. The advocacy of one person, collaborating with others who were willing to listen, had rewritten the rules. It was only later, sitting in the Velez CoLab, that the beautiful, unexpected symmetry of it all struck me. Here I was, an intern studying the intricate dynamics of human collaboration—how people work together to solve problems, build trust, and achieve shared goals. The very theory we explored on whiteboards and through data was the living practice that had just reshaped my future. My own life had become a case study. The success of this summer, and the subsequent offer to continue my research in the fall, wasn't just my victory. It was the victory of a team: an advocate who fought, parole officers who listened, and a system that, for a moment, proved it could be flexible. It was the triumph of collaboration. This experience, this Princeton chapter, solidified a conviction that has been forming in the crucible of my life: that the most profound and lasting solutions to our deepest social problems cannot be found in isolation. Technology, brilliant and transformative as it can be, when divorced from a deep, empathetic understanding of human needs and systemic injustices, becomes a hollow echo—a solution without a soul. Conversely, the most fervent advocacy for justice, without the powerful, scalable tools that technology offers, risks remaining a whisper in the storm, limited in its reach and impact. This is why I am embarking on a dual journey at Rutgers University, pursuing both a rigorous Computer Science degree in the Honors College and a Civil Justice minor in the Honors Living-Learning Community. This isn't a divided focus; it is my core thesis, the bridge I am building with every fiber of my being. My work in the Velez CoLab, transforming abstract organizational theory into the visceral tactical gameplay of EXOBOUND, has been a living laboratory for this belief. I learned that to make science accessible, to gather richer, more robust data, I had to translate complex mathematical tradeoffs into an intuitive, human-centered experience. This is the very essence of what I aim to do in the world: to take the abstract, often intimidating complexities of societal challenges and build tangible, accessible solutions. Imagine a future where parole reform isn't just debated in policy papers but is actively shaped by tools that leverage data to identify systemic biases and create more equitable pathways. Imagine technology that doesn't just manage cases but empowers individuals, helping them navigate complex systems with dignity and agency. This is the promise that lies at the intersection of Computer Science and Civil Justice. This is the foundation for the tech startup I envision—an enterprise dedicated to building platforms that truly serve humanity, bridging the gap between those who create the code and those who need its transformative power the most. My journey from a prison cell to a Princeton lab is a direct testament to the power of taking risks on human potential. The profound gift these programs offer is access—access to knowledge, to opportunity, and most importantly, to a new vision of what's possible. Now, I am committed to becoming a bridge-builder myself, creating new pathways for others to realize their own potential. I invite all dreamers, all builders, all those who believe in a world where compassion and code converge, to join me. Let us collaborate, not just on experiments, but on a future where every individual, regardless of their past, has the tools and the pathways to thrive. For the ultimate rescue is not pulling one person from the water; it is understanding the current, the tide, the unseen forces that pull people under. It is building a system that teaches everyone to swim, to navigate the treacherous waters of their own lives. The pain was the price of admission, but the elixir—the understanding that connection is the antidote to isolation, that collaboration can redeem any failure, that taking a risk on human potential is the only bet worth making—is priceless. And it is meant to be shared.",

        title: "The Day I Collaborated on My Professor's Passion Project",
        date: "July 31, 2025",
        category: "Research, Collaboration, Mentorship",
        excerpt: "The Princeton campus, with its hushed Gothic spires and centuries of ingrained intellect, has been my world for nine weeks now. It is a place of wonder, a dream I still navigate with a quiet, almost reverent awe. But within this hallowed ground, the most profound revelations have come not from solitary study, but from the electric current of collaboration. Specifically, from the moment I was invited to step into the shared intellectual space of Professor Natalia Velez. Professor Velez, whose brilliance I find as inspiring as it is intimidating—her own research has even delved into the very subject of competence —presented me with a choice over Zoom. Two assignments were laid before me, and I had the weekend to select my path. One was a solid, valuable project. The other was the formidable one: the abstract 'widget engineering' experiment she had devised years ago at MIT, a complex, mathematically heavy concept she had wanted to evolve for years but never had the chance. My attention, though, was caught. My life has always been deeply intertwined with people—leading teams, coaching, understanding group dynamics. The theory of organizational decision-making, of how humans collaborate under uncertainty, resonated with a deep, intuitive part of me. This wasn't just an academic exercise; it was the necessary study that would bring me the insight to truly implement science towards building real-world solutions. I chose the hard one. I chose her passion project. My role was not simply to execute. It was to bridge a chasm. Professor Velez is a mathematical genius, a mind forged at MIT, Stanford, and Harvard. Her experiment was scientifically powerful, a dispassionate, cerebral exercise in decision-making. But as I engaged with it, I realized that for broader audiences, for those whose leadership experience stemmed from the visceral realities of building a little swim school community, the decisions needed to feel more intuitive, more human. I voiced this, timidly at first, confessing that it felt 'mathematically heavy, made for engineers...flip of a coin.' Rather than dismiss my 'non-traditional' perspective, she heard it. 'But what if they are good at math?' she probed. 'Then it is a niche experiment,' I responded, 'not many managers are going to be that mathematically gifted to solve those problems fast enough to truly make a reliable answer. To reach more people, it must be made simpler, more intuitive.' Understanding that the goal was to make the science more accessible and human-centered, without losing its rigor, she welcomed the back-and-forth. This was the magic. My unique background—my Google Project Management certification , my entrepreneurial ventures where I learned to build for a target market , my years creating fitness programs as a personal trainer —became my arsenal. I wasn't just following instructions; I was collaborating on her vision, transforming the abstract into the tangible. This was the birth of EXOBOUND. We took the elegant mathematical tradeoff and reimagined it. Instead of 'widgets,' players would command a starship fleet, facing asteroids and enemy raiders, making life-or-death decisions about adaptation versus coordination with imperfect communication. The underlying science remained 100% valid, but the human experience was utterly transformed. The profound beauty of this collaboration unfolded further in unexpected moments. I recall sitting in the lab, captivated, as a brilliant Harvard student presented a complex new formula she had created. The elegance and sheer marvel of her mathematical construction filled me with awe. Then, my professor, sitting right beside me, effortlessly began reading the formula, engaging in a rapid, fluid back-and-forth with the student. They dissected it with the ease of picking apart a simple equation, yet their fascination with its creation was palpable. In that moment, surrounded by minds operating at such an exalted level, a powerful truth crystallized: my life's skills in connecting people, connecting disparate systems and organizations, were not just soft skills. They were the very conduits through which profound, tangible solutions could be implemented. It reaffirmed my growing conviction: it's about being in the right place, with the right people, who can support me to actually make this happen. Sometimes, in life, you're left with an idea, a vision of how things could be, but no clear path on how to bring it to fruition. But the more I am around these exceptional individuals, the more I witness their intellectual mastery, the more I see what 'possible' truly looks like. It is then that I can begin connecting the invisible pieces, drawing on the wisdom of my own complex journey from isolation to collaboration. This project, this collaboration on EXOBOUND, has been more than research; it has been a profound lesson in trust, in the alchemy that occurs when different minds converge, and in the magic that happens when a mentor empowers you to bring your unique perspective to her most cherished intellectual pursuits. It is a testament to the idea that true innovation is born not from singular genius, but from the powerful, shared act of building bridges.",
