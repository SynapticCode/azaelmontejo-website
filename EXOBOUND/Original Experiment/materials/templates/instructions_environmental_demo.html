<h1>Instructions</h1>
<p>You'll be assigned two scores for every Widget you make. These scores are <strong>loss scores</strong> - meaning that they're <emph>negative</emph> values that measure how far your Widgets are from ideal. Your goal in this game is to <strong>incur the smallest losses.</strong>
<p>First, you'll be given an <strong class="ideal-size-container">environment loss score</strong> based on how far your Widget is from the ideal size. 
    The closer the Widget is to the ideal size, the better it will function. </p>
<p>Let's do an analysis! Move the sliders to change the size of this widget. As you change the widget's size, we'll tell
    you your environment loss score. <strong>Please take your time to experiment and try lots of different sizesâ€”in the next
        slide, you'll be asked to report the ideal size for this widget.</strong></p>
