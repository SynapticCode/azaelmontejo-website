    `Ghosts dance in the void—raiders that Elena Velez never faced, equipped with stealth technology born from the ashes of her victory. 

[ENEMY_EVOLUTION] 

The enemy learned from Arcturus Prime that direct confrontation with human commanders ends in defeat. So they evolved beyond Elena's experience, developing camouflage that turns space itself into an enemy. 

[REPUTATION_INSERT] 

Your sensors flicker with phantom readings, each one a potential threat that Elena's training never prepared you for. The lever in your hands, forged from her destroyer's hull, must now guide weapons against enemies that exist in the spaces between what Elena could see and what she could imagine.`,
    
    // Trial 17
    `The stealth fields intensify, creating a battlefield where Elena's tried-and-true tactics become dangerous guesswork. 

[PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] 

She wrote extensively about target identification, but her wisdom assumes enemies that announce themselves through presence rather than absence. Today, you fight shadows that Elena would have dismissed as sensor malfunctions—until those shadows started killing her crews. 

[ENEMY_EVOLUTION] 

The raiders have weaponized uncertainty itself, turning your command training into a liability. Elena's doctrine demands you know your enemy; but what do you do when knowing becomes impossible?`,
    
    // Trial 18  
    `Through the stealth interference, you glimpse the true horror: these aren't just invisible raiders—they're learning to mimic your own ships' signatures. 

[REPUTATION_INSERT] 

Elena faced enemies that looked alien; you face enemies that look human until the moment they fire. The psychological warfare would have shattered Elena's crews, who trusted their sensors as much as they trusted her voice. 

You realize that the enemy hasn't just evolved beyond Elena's tactical knowledge—it has evolved beyond the fundamental assumptions that made her heroism possible. 

[PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] 

Trust itself has become a weapon turned against you.`,
    
    // Trial 19
    `The stealth technology reaches perfect efficiency—raiders that exist only in the moments between detection and destruction. 

[ENEMY_EVOLUTION] 

Elena's manual speaks of decisive action based on clear intelligence, but clear intelligence no longer exists. Every targeting decision becomes an act of faith in intuition over instruments, courage over confirmation. 

[REPUTATION_INSERT] 

Elena died knowing her enemy; you must choose whether to live by shooting at shadows or die by hesitating in the light. Her lever trembles under your touch, as if even her destroyer's metal recognizes the impossibility of the task before you.`,
    
    // Trial 20
    `In this final test of the invisible war, you discover what Elena never could: that sometimes the greatest act of heroism is admitting that heroic tactics aren't enough. 

[PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] 

The stealth raiders represent more than advanced technology—they represent the universe's response to human excellence. Elena's sacrifice created a standard so high that surpassing it required the enemy to abandon conventional warfare entirely. 

[ENEMY_EVOLUTION] 

Your choice now isn't just tactical—it's philosophical. Do you honor Elena by following her proven methods, or do you honor her by proving that human adaptability remains superior to any technological advantage our enemies can devise?`
