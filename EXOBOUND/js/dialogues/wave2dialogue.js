// Theme: Solar interference challenges fleet coordination
window.wave2Dialogue = [
    // Trial 6
    `Solar flares scream across the void, just as they did during Elena's final hour at Arcturus Prime. Your communications array flickers with the same static that severed Elena's voice from her fleet in those last desperate moments. [REPUTATION_INSERT] The electromagnetic storm doesn't discriminate—it silences heroes and rookies alike. Elena taught us that when words fail, doctrine must speak. But doctrine was born from a different war, a simpler enemy. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] Today, as interference corrupts your transmissions, you must choose: trust in Elena's proven methods, or forge new paths through the storm that claimed her voice forever.`,
    
    // Trial 7  
    `The interference intensifies, turning your bridge into an echo of Elena's darkest hour. She faced this same electromagnetic fury when the Velez Deathstar's radiation surge cut her fleet communications at the Battle of Proxima. [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] History records her final transmission before the static took her: "When my voice fails, let my example guide you." But examples from the past may not illuminate the shadows of today's battlefield. Elena's doctrine was written in clear channels and perfect coordination. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] What do you write when the universe itself conspires to silence command?`,
    
    // Trial 8
    `Through the crackling static, you hear phantom echoes of Elena's last orders—or perhaps it's just the electromagnetic storm playing tricks on a commander's mind. The communication blackout transforms every decision into an act of faith. [REPUTATION_INSERT] Elena's crews knew her voice so well they could predict her commands in silence. Your pilots know only stories, legends, and the weight of expectations. In this moment of severed connection, you become the voice Elena couldn't be—not because you're replacing her, but because you're carrying her forward into uncharted darkness.`,
    
    // Trial 9
    `The solar storm reaches its peak, creating conditions that would have challenged even Elena Velez herself. She never faced interference this severe—the storm that took her voice was a whisper compared to this electromagnetic hurricane. [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] Your pilots float in isolation, each ship an island in a sea of static. Elena's doctrine was built on unity of command, but what happens when command itself becomes fragmented? [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] This is the test she never faced: leading not through inspiration, but through the courage to act when no one can hear your reasons why.`,
    
    // Trial 10
    `As the interference begins to fade, you realize this storm has taught you something Elena never learned: that command isn't just about giving orders—it's about trusting others to carry your intentions when words fail. [REPUTATION_INSERT] Elena died trying to maintain control in chaos. You've just proven that letting go, sometimes, is the highest form of command. The static clears, and your fleet emerges changed—not following Elena's doctrine, but embodying her spirit. In silence, you've found a voice she never could: the voice of evolution built upon the foundation of sacrifice.`
