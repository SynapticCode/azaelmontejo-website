    // Trial 21
    `The asteroid before you carries the scars of Elena's final battle—pocked with craters that speak of desperate defensive actions. 

[REPUTATION_INSERT] 

This isn't just another Velez Deathstar; it's a monument to every colony that couldn't be saved, every evacuation that came too late. Elena's doctrine was born from exactly this scenario: when the asteroid reaches atmosphere, nothing else matters. 

[ENEMY_EVOLUTION] 

But the raiders swirling around this tomb-world have learned from Elena's sacrifice. They know that desperate commanders make predictable choices. 

[PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] 

Your allocation becomes more than tactics—it becomes philosophy.`,
    
    // Trial 22
    `The volatile asteroid pulses with unstable energy, each flare a reminder of the worlds Elena couldn't save. 

[PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] 

She wrote: "Environmental threats are absolute—raiders are relative." But what happens when the environment itself has been weaponized by the relative threat? 

[ENEMY_EVOLUTION] 

The raiders seem to be herding the asteroid, guiding its trajectory toward populated systems. Elena's binary thinking—asteroid or raiders—breaks down when the enemy makes them one unified weapon. 

[REPUTATION_INSERT] 

Your choice today rewrites the fundamental assumptions of human tactical doctrine.`,
    
    // Trial 23  
    `As the asteroid's instability reaches critical levels, you understand why Elena's doctrine feels inadequate here. 

[REPUTATION_INSERT] 

She faced simple choices: save the colonies by stopping the asteroid, or lose everything by fighting raiders. Today, stopping the asteroid might doom the colonies anyway if the raiders complete their gravitational manipulation. 

[PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] 

This is the evolution Elena never predicted: when the enemy learns to turn your own priorities against you. 

[ENEMY_EVOLUTION] 

The lever in your hands carries the weight of impossible decisions—and the possibility of unprecedented solutions.`,
    
    // Trial 24
    `The environmental threat reaches its crescendo as asteroid fragments begin breaking away—each piece a potential colony-killer guided by raider intelligence. 

[ENEMY_EVOLUTION] 

Elena's sacrifice taught the enemy that humans will always prioritize environmental threats. So they've made environmental protection into a trap. 

[REPUTATION_INSERT] 

Every instinct Elena trained into the fleet screams "focus on the asteroid," but that focus is exactly what the raiders are counting on. 

[PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] 

This is the test of evolving beyond even our deepest convictions.`,
    
    // Trial 25
    `In this moment of cascading environmental collapse, you realize that Elena's greatest lesson wasn't about priorities—it was about impossible choices. 

[PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] 

She didn't save colonies by following doctrine; she saved them by accepting that some tactical decisions transcend doctrine entirely. 

[ENEMY_EVOLUTION] 

The asteroid and raiders before you represent the enemy's ultimate understanding of human psychology. 

[REPUTATION_INSERT] 

Your allocation determines whether Elena's legacy becomes humanity's limitation or its transcendence.`
