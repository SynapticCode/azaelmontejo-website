    `The fleet divides before your eyes—not in space, but in spirit. [REPUTATION_INSERT] Half your pilots cling to Elena's doctrine like a lifeline; the other half whisper of new tactics born from necessity. [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] Elena faced external enemies; you face the harder fight—the enemy within doubt itself. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] Your allocation today chooses not just a target, but whether the fleet will shatter or evolve.`,
    
    `Communications fracture into competing voices—some calling for Elena's wisdom, others demanding tactical innovation. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] The enemy has learned that human strength lies in unity of purpose. [REPUTATION_INSERT] Every order you give is questioned, every choice analyzed for heresy or cowardice. [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] This is warfare beyond weapons—this is the battle for the human soul.`,
    
    `The schism deepens as Elena's most faithful followers openly question your departures from doctrine. [REPUTATION_INSERT] The raiders seem to sense the discord, pressing attacks that force impossible choices between loyalty and necessity. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] Elena never faced a crew divided against itself. [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] Your lever becomes the fulcrum on which human unity balances.`,
    
    `As factions crystallize within your own fleet, you realize that Elena's greatest victory may become humanity's greatest weakness. [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] Perfect doctrine creates perfect predictability. [REPUTATION_INSERT] Today's allocation determines whether Elena's legacy unifies or destroys the fleet she died to protect. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] Some truths transcend loyalty itself.`,
    
    `In this moment of ultimate division, you understand what Elena could never have foreseen: that her sacrifice would one day require transcendence rather than reverence. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] Your allocation becomes both tactical decision and theological statement. [REPUTATION_INSERT] Choose carefully—you're not just commanding ships, you're commanding the future of human adaptability.`

// WAVE 7: The Crucible Phase I (Trials 31-35) 
window.wave7Dialogue = [
    `The crucible burns away everything but truth. [REPUTATION_INSERT] Elena's doctrine, your innovations, the fleet's divided loyalties—all melt in the heat of ultimate testing. [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] Yet in this impossible moment, clarity emerges. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] Your allocation today transcends doctrine and innovation alike—it becomes pure command distilled to essence.`,
    
    `All pretense falls away as the battle reaches transcendent intensity. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] The raiders move with the precision of a universe learning to destroy hope itself. [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] [REPUTATION_INSERT] But hope, you discover, is not something external to be destroyed—it's something internal to be forged. Your lever awaits the touch of pure will.`,
    
    `The crucible reveals what Elena and you both truly are: not doctrine or innovation, but human adaptability facing the infinite dark. [REPUTATION_INSERT] [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] The enemy expects human patterns. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] Give them human transcendence instead.`,
    
    `In the heart of the crucible, you and Elena's spirit finally stand as equals—two commanders facing the impossible across time itself. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] The raiders have learned everything humanity can teach them. [REPUTATION_INSERT] Now teach them what humanity can become.`,
    
    `The crucible's final lesson: Elena didn't die for doctrine—she died for the possibility that doctrine could evolve. [REPUTATION_INSERT] [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] This is the moment Elena's sacrifice was always meant to create: not perfect followers, but perfect adaptation.`

// WAVE 8: The Crucible Phase II (Trials 36-40)
window.wave8Dialogue = [
    `The crucible's fire reveals the final truth: you and Elena were never meant to be the same commander. [REPUTATION_INSERT] She was the foundation; you are the structure. [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] The enemy that destroyed her has created its own destroyer in you. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] Your allocation writes the next chapter of human survival in the stars.`,
    
    `Elena's lever responds to your touch now as if it were always meant for your hands. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] The raiders face something they've never encountered: a humanity that learns faster than they can adapt. [REPUTATION_INSERT] This is the culmination Elena died to make possible.`,
    
    `The final barriers fall away between past wisdom and present necessity. [REPUTATION_INSERT] Elena's doctrine and your innovation merge into something greater than either alone. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] Your allocation echoes across time—Elena's approval and your own certainty finally in perfect harmony.`,
    
    `In this moment of perfect synthesis, you realize that Elena's greatest gift wasn't her doctrine—it was her demonstration that humans can choose sacrifice over surrender. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] [REPUTATION_INSERT] [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] The lever awaits the touch that will define humanity's future among the stars.`,
    
    `The crucible's transformation is complete. You are no longer Elena's successor or her challenger—you are humanity's next evolution. [REPUTATION_INSERT] [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] Your allocation today determines whether humanity stagnates or soars beyond every limitation the universe can devise.`

// WAVE 9: The New Legend Phase I (Trials 41-45)
window.wave9Dialogue = [
    `Your legend begins to eclipse Elena's not through superiority, but through completion. [REPUTATION_INSERT] She began the sentence; you complete the thought. [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] Future commanders will study your choices as you once studied Elena's. Choose with the weight of immortality in your hands.`,
    
    `The fleet speaks your name now with the same reverence once reserved for Elena's memory. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] Your greatest challenge isn't defeating the enemy—it's ensuring that your legacy enables rather than constrains those who follow. [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] [REPUTATION_INSERT] The lever responds to the touch of living legend.`,
    
    `Elena's shadow finally lifts, replaced by your own growing light. [REPUTATION_INSERT] The transformation is complete: from student to master, from follower to leader, from human to legend. [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] But legends are dangerous things—they can inspire or they can imprison. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] Your allocation today determines which kind of legend you become.`,
    
    `The enemy that learned from Elena's patterns now faces the impossible task of learning from limitless innovation. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] They adapted to human predictability; they cannot adapt to human transcendence. [REPUTATION_INSERT] [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] Your choices resonate beyond this battle, beyond this war, into the very future of consciousness itself.`,
    
    `In surpassing Elena, you honor her in the only way that matters: by proving that human potential has no ceiling. [REPUTATION_INSERT] [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] Your allocation echoes across generations: the moment humanity learned it could always become more than it was.`

    `The final battle approaches, and with it, the ultimate test of everything you and Elena represent. [REPUTATION_INSERT] She faced her ending with courage; you face your beginning with wisdom. [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] Your allocation today doesn't just choose targets—it chooses humanity's cosmic destiny.`,
    
    `Elena's lever feels weightless now, responsive to the slightest intention. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] The fleet moves as an extension of your will, but your will has become an extension of human evolution itself. [REPUTATION_INSERT] [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] This is the moment all previous moments prepared for: the transcendence of limitation itself.`,
    
    `The penultimate choice arrives weighted with infinite consequence. [REPUTATION_INSERT] Elena's sacrifice, your transformation, the fleet's evolution—all converge toward this singular moment of possibility. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] Your allocation reverberates through the fabric of space-time itself, reshaping the rules of survival.`,
    
    `As the final confrontation looms, you and Elena stand together across time—two points of light in the cosmic dark, proof that consciousness can triumph over entropy. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] [REPUTATION_INSERT] [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] This is the moment when legend becomes reality, when potential becomes actuality.`,
    
    `The ultimate allocation: not between asteroid and raider, but between limitation and transcendence. [REPUTATION_INSERT] Elena's final gift reveals itself—not her doctrine, but her demonstration that any ending can become a beginning. [PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] [ENEMY_EVOLUTION] Your choice echoes across eternity: the moment consciousness chose to evolve rather than merely survive.`
