    `This lever was forged from the hull of Elena Velez's destroyer, salvaged from the wreckage at Arcturus Prime. Every Tactical Officer has gripped this same control, feeling the ghost of her final decision. Left means Elena's Path: trust her sacrifice, follow the doctrine that her death proved could work. Right means the Velez Protocol: honor her spirit by daring to evolve beyond her limits. When you press FIRE, you're not just commanding ships—you're choosing which aspect of Elena's legacy will guide you: her proven doctrine, or her untested final theory.`,
    `In her final moments, Elena Velez made a horrifying discovery: the Deathstar doesn't just launch raiders—it IS the raiders. Every small ship is a neuron in its distributed brain, a fragment of its immortal consciousness. When you strike raiders, you're performing battlefield surgery on a living being. But here's why Elena's Protocol was never implemented: admitting the raiders are the true target means admitting that Elena died following the wrong strategy. Her sacrifice becomes not heroic doctrine, but tragic mistake. This is why targeting raiders is heretical—not because it doesn't work, but because accepting it works means questioning the most sacred death in our history.`,
    `Static fills the void, just as it did in Elena's final hour. In the heat of battle, your voice becomes Elena's voice—and like hers, it may not reach every ear. Your pilots, raised on stories of Elena's courage, will revert to her doctrine when communications fail. They'll target the asteroid not out of ignorance, but out of reverence—reverence for the woman who proved it could work, reverence for the certainty her sacrifice bought us. Watch as your grand strategy fractures against the weight of Elena's legacy. This is the burden of command: leading minds shaped by heroes you must sometimes surpass.`,
    `Every number echoes Elena's last transmission. Adaptation Loss: how far you strayed from perfect evolution—did you grow beyond Elena's limits or cling to her comfort? Coordination Loss: the price paid when brilliant minds move as fragments of Elena's broken final order—how many souls were lost to reverence? Bonus: Elena's spirit judging your command—did you honor her sacrifice through growth or stagnation? These scores are not just data; they are Elena's ghost whispering approval or warning from the void.`,
    `This is your moment to step beyond Elena's shadow and into your own legend. She faced the Velez Deathstar with doctrine and died a hero. You face it with her wisdom AND the knowledge her death could not provide. The enemy that consumed her has evolved, but so have you. Set your allocation not just as Elena's successor, but as the guardian she died trying to create. Her lever awaits your touch. Her legacy awaits your choice. The future awaits your courage. FIRE when ready, and may your legend honor hers while surpassing it.`
