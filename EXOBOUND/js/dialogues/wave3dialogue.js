    // Trial 11
    `The sensors scream warnings that Elena Velez would recognize—massive raider formations approaching in numbers that dwarf anything she faced at Arcturus Prime. 

[ENEMY_EVOLUTION] 

Elena's final battle featured twelve raiders; today you face three times that number. The Velez Deathstar has learned, evolved, spawning swarms that would have overwhelmed even Elena's legendary tactical brilliance. 

[REPUTATION_INSERT] 

Your fleet is larger than hers was, but so is the threat. Elena's doctrine spoke of priority targeting, but when every target demands priority, her wisdom requires translation into something she never imagined: mass coordination warfare.`,
    
    // Trial 12
    `The swarm divides, executing maneuvers that Elena documented in her final tactical logs—but magnified beyond her worst predictions. 

[PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] 

She wrote: "Raiders fight as extensions of a single mind, but that mind can be confused by focused pressure." Today, that single mind has grown into a distributed intelligence that learns from every encounter. 

Elena's strategies assume small-unit tactics; you face strategic-level deployment. 

[ENEMY_EVOLUTION] 

The lever beneath your hand carries the weight of evolution—not just Elena's legacy, but its necessary metamorphosis into something she could not have foreseen.`,
    
    // Trial 13  
    `Through your viewports, you witness formations that would have terrified Elena Velez—not because she lacked courage, but because they represent the evolutionary response to her heroism. 

[REPUTATION_INSERT] 

Every tactic she developed, every victory she achieved, taught the enemy how to counter human ingenuity. The raiders move in patterns designed to exploit the weaknesses Elena never knew she was revealing. 

This is the price of heroism: your victories become the enemy's lessons. 

[PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] 

You must now surpass not just Elena's achievements, but the limitations her success inadvertently created.`,
    
    // Trial 14
    `The swarm's coordination reaches levels that Elena could never have predicted. Her tactical manual assumes that overwhelming numbers create chaos in enemy ranks—but these numbers create symphony. 

[ENEMY_EVOLUTION] 

Each raider knows its place in a vast, predatory ballet that turns Elena's assumptions inside out. 

[REPUTATION_INSERT] 

You realize with growing dread that you're not just fighting the enemy Elena died to stop; you're fighting the enemy that her death helped create. 

Every principle she died to establish must now be questioned, not because she was wrong, but because being right isn't enough anymore.`,
    
    // Trial 15
    `In this moment, facing the ultimate test of Elena's tactical legacy, you understand what she never could: that true heroism isn't about perfect doctrine—it's about perfect adaptation. 

[PERFORMANCE_BRANCH] 

Elena died following principles that saved thousands. You must live by principles that will save millions. 

[ENEMY_EVOLUTION] 

The swarm before you represents not just an enemy, but an examination of everything Elena stood for. Your allocation becomes more than targeting priority; it becomes a declaration of whether humanity will remain bound by the heroism of the past or liberate itself through the courage to evolve beyond even its greatest legends.`
